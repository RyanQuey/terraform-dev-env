# Setup

1. Run `./setup.sh`

This should work whether running from windows or from linux, as long as docker cli is already installed...once we write a script that Windows can use (ie not a bash script)

# TODOs for this project:
- use ansible for this instead of bash script?
- test in windows, so can spin up without any linux box running
- more options!
